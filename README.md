# A Modern Web Scraper for the RPI Student Information System (SIS)

This repository contains source code for a web scraper designed to fetch course data from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's new SIS, which replaced the old SIS on September 17th, 2025.

The scraper operates on endpoints within the student registration system, which is accessible through [this link](https://sis9.rpi.edu/StudentRegistrationSsb/ssb/registration) without needing authentication.

## Data Collected

This scraper is designed to fetch course data from any range of years and academic terms, with Summer 1998 being the earliest available term.

A JSON file is produced for every academic term processed; see [sample output JSON data format](#sample-output-json-format) for format details.

Course information included in the output data include:

- Course code (e.g. CSCI 1100)
- Name
- Description
- Corequisites
- Prerequisites (with AND, OR relationships)
- Crosslists
- Attributes
- Restrictions (with restriction types)
- Credit Hours
- Section CRNs
- Section instructors (and RCSIDs)
- Seat data (capacity, registered, and open)

## About the SIS Scraper

There are two distinct steps that take place within the SIS scraper:

**Scraping Step** \
Scraping involves fetching data from SIS endpoints and writing them to JSON after some basic formatting of the data. Code mappings are also generated and written to JSON during this step, such as subject code-to-name, restriction code-to-name, and so on. The extent of these mappings depend on the range of academic terms the scraper is ran on; more terms results in more comprehensive mappings. The mappings and scraper data are written to separate directories.

**Postprocess Step** \
The postprocess step operates on the JSON data outputted by the scraper and codifies values such as subject names, restriction names, attribute names, and instructor names using code mappings generated by the scraper. The scraper data is not modified in-place; instead, processed data is written to a separate directory from the scraper data.

_The postprocess step is tailored to the needs of Project CARPI, so the resulting data format may not be desirable for general use._

## Running the SIS Scraper

_The scraper requires Python >= 3.11 to run._

Create a `.env` file in the `sis_scraper` directory where the `main.py` script is. An `example.env` script has been provided in the repository for reference; you may simply copy-paste the contents to use default values.

Running the SIS scraper is as simple as running `main.py`. Optional flags `--scrape-only` and `--postprocess-only` may be specified to disable a step of the scraper.

**Windows**

```powershell
cd sis_scraper
python.exe main.py [--scrape-only | --postprocess-only] start_year end_year
```

**MacOS/Unix**

```bash
cd sis_scraper
python3 main.py [--scrape-only | --postprocess-only] start_year end_year
```
